# Battleship

#### Description
A web application of commonly known multiplayer game Battleship with Node.js as back-end.

#### Guide
1. Start in *index.html* and choose nickname. Then click **Join game**.
2. In *locate-set.html* you have to choose position for 5 ships you have give. Starting from the longest and ending in the shortest. After it's done, you'll be redirected.
3. Next, in *lobby.html* you have to **challange** some player to fight with you. The opponent has to do it as well. After you both challange yourself, you should click again on your nicknames in lobby and you will be redirected to *game.html*.
4. Each time you want to acquire updated state of battle, you have to click **Refresh** button. Click over **Enemy ships** to attack.
